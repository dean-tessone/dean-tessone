# 👋 Hi, I’m Dean

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **PhD student in Molecular and Computational Biology** at the **University of Southern California (USC)**. I build and apply both convential and deep learning models to understand complex biological systems—particularly those involved in cancer biology, metastasis, and rare cell detection through **liquid biopsy**.
